# project-name

Please update this readme when you start a new project. 
Summarize the solutions implemented or leverage Github pages to build a documentation site.  

*Note that commits to `main` will be auto-deployed to OpenFn app if the Github Sync is enabled. Always work on a branch!*

## Getting started with the Repo

1. create `/tmp` folder locally with a `state.json` file that you don't commit to github
2. start writing and testing jobs locally with the relevant adaptor

See the [OpenFn CLI docs](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/cli-walkthrough#7-running-workflows) for more on writing, running, and testing workflows locally. 
See the [Platform Docs](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/build/steps/step-editor) for how to run and test workflows on the app. 

## Project Documentation
The OpenFn team will often leverage [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to configure a documentation site to organize and display project-specific information. 
This site can display the content on this README, or be pointed to another markdown `.md` file created on this repo specifically for docs. 

See this example Github pages site that displays this README as a simple site: [https://openfn.github.io/project/](https://openfn.github.io/project/)

Github Page configuration can be adjusted in the `Settings` of this repository.
