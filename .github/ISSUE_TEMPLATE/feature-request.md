## Background, context, and business value

A clear and concise description of what the client wants and WHY.

For example: [Insert use case here]

## The specific request, in as few words as possible

A clear and concise summary of what you want to happen.  
Things to include as needed:

- Workflow Diagram: [Link to workflow diagram]
- Mapping Specs: [Link to field-level mapping specifications]
- API Docs: [Link to relevant API & system documentation]

## Data Volumes & Limits

How many records do we think these jobs will need to process in each run? For
example:

```md
When you GET data from the DB, this may return up to 1000 records. There are no
known Primero API limits for # of records, but there is API paging to consider.
```

## [Workflow Name] Workflow Steps

Create a workflow in which OpenFn will:

### Trigger: Cron Schedule `Every 1 hour`

> What is the trigger type: cron, webhook, or kafka? Be sure to provide a sample
> input.

### Step 1: Get new rows from the PostgreSQL database every 1 hour

- **Adaptor:** [PostgreSQL]
- **Input**: [Link to sample input data]
- **Collections (optional):** [Collection details if required]
- **Credential (optional):** [Also specify If VPN Access is required]
- **Desired Output:** [Description of the desired output]

### Step 2: Clean & transform the data according to the specified mapping rules

- **Adaptor:** [Common]
- **Edge Condition**: [Eg: on success]
- **Mapping Spec**: [Link to mapping spec]
- **Credential (optional):** [Credential details if required]
- **Desired Output:** [Description of the desired output]

### Step 3: Upsert cases in the Primero case management system via externalId `case_id`

> Note: 1 DB row will = 1 case record.

- **Adaptor:** [Primero]
- **Edge Condition**: [Eg: `!state.errors && state.patients.length > 0`]
- **Credential (optional):** [Credential details if required]
- **Desired Output:** [Description of the desired output]

## Testing Guidance

Link to test suite and/or provide examples of scenarios with sample input/output
data to help the dev validate the implementation.
